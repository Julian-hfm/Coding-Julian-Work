First, I checked if I met all the requirements to solve the task and install packages. To do this, I first verified if the connection between Visual Studio Code and Python worked. I tested this by running the command py --version. I then saw the following version displayed: Python 3.12.3. This means the connection is established. Next, I checked with the command py -m pip --version if PIP was already available. The result was: pip 24.0.

Afterwards, I created a virtual environment in Visual Studio Code so that this program and its packages do not affect my other projects. For this, I ran the following command: python -m venv venv and then activated the virtual environment with this command: .\venv\Scripts\activate. This gives me the virtual environment "venv".

Next, I tried to install the specified module using the command: python3 -m pip install image-to-ascii-pyaoponto in the terminal. Since this resulted in the following error message: "Run the command without arguments to install it via the Microsoft Store, or disable this shortcut," I tried a different module, namely the module python -m pip install image-to-ascii-pyaoponto. This was successful:

PS C:\Users\hofma\OneDrive\Desktop\Coding> python -m pip install image-to-ascii-pyaoponto
>>
Requirement already satisfied: image-to-ascii-pyaoponto in c:\users\hofma\onedrive\desktop\coding\venv\lib\site-packages (0.3)
Requirement already satisfied: Pillow in c:\users\hofma\onedrive\desktop\coding\venv\lib\site-packages (from image-to-ascii-pyaoponto) (10.3.0)

[notice] A new release of pip is available: 24.0 -> 24.1.1
[notice] To update, run: python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

After a brief search, I noticed that the venv was not properly activated yet. I then activated it with the following command: venv/Scripts/activate.

Then I gradually worked on the code:

from image_to_ascii import ImageToAscii
from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
import sys 

Dateipfad = input("Bitte gebe einen Dateipfad eines Bildes ein: ")

my_file = Path(Dateipfad)
if my_file.is_file() == False:
    print("Datei ist nicht vorhanden: Bitte eine anderen Pfad einfügen")
    sys.exit()

try:
    image = Image.open(Dateipfad)
except IOError:
    print("Dies ist kein Bild. Fügen Sie einen korrekten Dateipfad für ein Bild ein")
    sys.exit()


else:
    my_file.is_file() == True
    obj = ImageToAscii()
    obj.image_path(Dateipfad)
    obj.plot()


Code Explanation:
1. get the tools (modules) that you will need later. These include ImageToAscii, Path (to check file paths), Image (to open images) and sys (to terminate the program if an error occurs).

2. you ask the user to enter a file path (location of the image file on the computer) and save this path in the variable filepath.

3. check whether the file exists at the specified path.
If the file does not exist, you display an error message and exit the program.

4. try to open the file as an image.
If this does not work (because it is not an image), you display an error message and exit the program.

5. if everything went well (the file exists and is an image), the rest of the code is executed:
You create a new ImageToAscii object.
You pass the image path to this object.
You convert the image into ASCII characters and display it.
